## APL

<a name="apl-general-purpose-machine-learning"></a>
#### General-Purpose Machine Learning
* [naive-apl](https://github.com/mattcunningham/naive-apl) - Naive Bayesian Classifier implementation in APL. **[Deprecated]**



<a name="tools"></a>
## Tools

<a name="tools-neural-networks"></a>
#### Neural Networks
* [layer](https://github.com/cloudkj/layer) - Neural network inference from the command line

<a name="tools-misc"></a>
#### Misc

* [Pinecone](https://www.pinecone.io/) - Vector database for applications that require real-time, scalable vector embedding and similarity search.
* [CatalyzeX](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/code-finder-for-research/aikkeehnlfpamidigaffhfmgbkdeheil) - Browser extension ([Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/code-finder-for-research/aikkeehnlfpamidigaffhfmgbkdeheil) and [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/code-finder-catalyzex/)) that automatically finds and shows code implementations for machine learning papers anywhere: Google, Twitter, Arxiv, Scholar, etc.
* [ML Workspace](https://github.com/ml-tooling/ml-workspace) - All-in-one web-based IDE for machine learning and data science. The workspace is deployed as a docker container and is preloaded with a variety of popular data science libraries (e.g., Tensorflow, PyTorch) and dev tools (e.g., Jupyter, VS Code).
* [Notebooks](https://github.com/rlan/notebooks) - A starter kit for Jupyter notebooks and machine learning. Companion docker images consist of all combinations of python versions, machine learning frameworks (Keras, PyTorch and Tensorflow) and CPU/CUDA versions.
* [DVC](https://github.com/iterative/dvc) - Data Science Version Control is an open-source version control system for machine learning projects with pipelines support. It makes ML projects reproducible and shareable.
* [Kedro](https://github.com/quantumblacklabs/kedro/) - Kedro is a data and development workflow framework that implements best practices for data pipelines with an eye towards productionizing machine learning models.
* [guild.ai](https://guild.ai/) - Tool to log, analyze, compare and "optimize" experiments. It's cross-platform and framework independent, and provided integrated visualizers such as tensorboard.
* [Sacred](https://github.com/IDSIA/sacred) - Python tool to help  you configure, organize, log and reproduce experiments. Like a notebook lab in the context of Chemistry/Biology. The community has built multiple add-ons leveraging the proposed standard.
* [MLFlow](https://mlflow.org/) - platform to manage the ML lifecycle, including experimentation, reproducibility and deployment. Framework and language agnostic, take a look at all the built-in integrations.
* [Weights & Biases](https://www.wandb.com/) - Machine learning experiment tracking, dataset versioning, hyperparameter search, visualization, and collaboration
* More tools to improve the ML lifecycle: [Catalyst](https://github.com/catalyst-team/catalyst), [PachydermIO](https://www.pachyderm.io/). The following are Github-alike and targeting teams [Weights & Biases](https://www.wandb.com/), [Neptune.Ml](https://neptune.ml/), [Comet.ml](https://www.comet.ml/), [Valohai.ai](https://valohai.com/), [DAGsHub](https://DAGsHub.com/).
* [MachineLearningWithTensorFlow2ed](https://www.manning.com/books/machine-learning-with-tensorflow-second-edition) - a book on general purpose machine learning techniques regression, classification, unsupervised clustering, reinforcement learning, auto encoders, convolutional neural networks, RNNs, LSTMs, using TensorFlow 1.14.1.
* [m2cgen](https://github.com/BayesWitnesses/m2cgen) - A tool that allows the conversion of ML models into native code (Java, C, Python, Go, JavaScript, Visual Basic, C#, R, PowerShell, PHP, Dart) with zero dependencies.
* [CML](https://github.com/iterative/cml) - A library for doing continuous integration with ML projects. Use GitHub Actions & GitLab CI to train and evaluate models in production like environments and automatically generate visual reports with metrics and graphs in pull/merge requests. Framework & language agnostic.
* [Pythonizr](https://pythonizr.com) - An online tool to generate boilerplate machine learning code that uses scikit-learn.
* [Flyte](https://flyte.org/) - Flyte makes it easy to create concurrent, scalable, and maintainable workflows for machine learning and data processing.
