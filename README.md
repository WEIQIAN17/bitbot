## Introduction
This project is to design a web-based cryptocurrency trading bot. The website designed to recognize the crypto-market’s trends and automatically execute trades based on customer’s configurable trading algorithms.

## Motivation
### Booming market
Bitcoin is a purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash that would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution[1]. As the most acceptable digital currency, bitcoin’s price has skyrocketed, especially 2017 after bitcoin hit historical high peak at nearly $20,000, people all around the world have been clamoring to trade in bitcoin and other altcoins, investors continued to pump money into cryptocurrency and blockchain startups. 

### Problem and Solution
The problem with any commodity in the global marketplace is traders cannot be at their station 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Apple co-founder and tech guru Steve Wozniak recently admitted that he had sold his entire holdings of bitcoin because he had grown tired of constantly looking to see what the price was. Even the most dedicated trader will not want to spend their entire life staring at cryptocurrency price charts either. Trading in cryptocurrencies is particularly addictive because the market is highly volatile. Bitcoin prices can and have dropped by as much as 25% in a day. While investors who are in for the long term might not worry about taking advantage of such fluctuations, cryptocurrency traders can make huge amounts of money from such volatility.

The solution to this problem is the automated trading bot. Such bots have been used by companies to set buy/sell commodities on global stock exchanges for decades. Trading bots help to automate the process and thereby relieving pressure on companies and traders. Trading bots are software programs that use API’s to interact with financial exchanges. They actively monitor exchanges around the clock and will react in accordance to whatever predetermined criteria they have been programmed with.

### Robinhood business model analysis
Robinhood is one of the most popular crypto and stock trading platform. It doesn’t charge any fees for trading stocks and ETFs, and claims to extend that facility to cryptocurrencies as well. However, several reviewers have pointed to Robinhood’s Crypto User Agreement where it notes that the platform will pass on any fees charged by intermediaries to the user. Users also claim that these fees are already included in the price of the cypto that’s displayed to the trader[2]. 
Anther downside of trading on Robinhood is that it lacks of automation algorithms which can help traders to protect from sharp loss. In another word, Robin hood doesn’t solve the problem of price volatility. 


### Our business model 
We, here, offer a trading web service that provide its own trading algorithms and portfolio management services for the customers to grow their cryptocurrency assets and value. By offering functions such as strategy automation, real-time event notifications, back testing, etc.,
